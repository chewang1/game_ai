The framework is provided by the instructor.
I only provide my code samples in pathfinding.


movement.h and movement_student.cpp - my code

How to work:
1.Please run pathfinding.exe in the pathfinding folder.
2.Click on the map, the agent will start to find the path.
3.Using next map to change map. You can toggle on/off other attributes in the map.
4.Toggle off single step before using time test long. Time test long is a timer to record a long path time spending.
